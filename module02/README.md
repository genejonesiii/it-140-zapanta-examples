## 1.  Arithmetic Expresions
This script should basic math equations.  Examples using order of operation (PEMDAS) is also
demonstrated in this program.

**TEXT SOURCE:**  32. Arithmetic Operators

## 2.  IF introduction
The next example will show variables in use, along with output of the results on screen.

**TEXT SOURCE:** 40. Comparison Operators; 46. Introducing the if and if/else statements

## 3.  IF block example
This program shows a basic IF block

**TEXT SOURCE:** 40. Comparison Operators; 46. Introducing the if and if/else statements

## 4.  Nested IF
Demonstrates the use of a nested IF/ELSE structure.

**TEXT SOURCE:**  40. Comparison Operators; 47. Using Multiple Conditions; 49. Nesting Conditional Statements

## 5.  Odd/Even
The program demonstrates the use of the modulus operator in determine if a number is odd or even.

**TEXT SOURCE:**  37. Modulus; 40. Comparison Operators

## 6.  IF/ELSE IF
This program demonstrates the use of an if/else if structure.

**TEXT SOURCE:**  47. Using Multiple Conditions

## 7. Logical Operators
This example will reinforce the AND, OR, and NOT operators that drive decision making in programs.

**TXT SOURCE:** 42. Logical Operators

## 8.  EXTRA LEARNING:  Use of a "menu"
Writing effective user interfaces is an important consideration when developing applications.  This example will dmeonstrate a
menu-driven program that will allow customers to sign-up for a membership.
