# initialize variables to values
i = 2
j = 3
k = 4

a = 0.5
b = 3.0

# addition
l = i + 2
print (l)

# subtraction
l = l - j
print (l)

# multiplication (*)
l = i * j * k
print (l)

# division (/)
l = k / i
print (l)

# floating-point multiplication
c = b * a
print (c)

# floating-point division
c = b / a
print (c)
