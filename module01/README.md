# Module 01

All sample files will be sorted in order to run.  For reference, a list of programs will be provided in this page.  Please see the README.md file in the root of this repository for directions on how to clone the files to your Codio environment.

# Python Scripts

1.  Hello World
2.  Use of variables
3.  Basic Arithmetic
4.  Order of operations.
5.  Input via Terminal
6.  Functions that do not return a value
7.  Function that returns a value.
8.  Use of a "main" function.


## 1.  Hello World
This script will print the words "Hello World" on screen.  By default, the "print" function will output a string and add
what we would call a "line break".

**TEXT SOURCE:**  15. String

## 2.  Use of variables
The next example will show variables in use, along with output of the results on screen.

**TEXT SOURCE:** 12. Data Types; 13. Numbers; 14. Boolean; 15. String; 16. Variables

## 3.  Basic Arithmetic
This program will show the basic math operations.

**TEXT SOURCE:** 13. Numbers; 32. Arithmetic Operators

## 4.  Input via Terminal
This program will demonstrate how input happens via command-line arguments in the terminal.  This is a useful
technique if your Python script is going to be scheduled.

**TEXT SOURCE:**  1. 1. Inputs and outputs (Numeric and Strings assignment)

## 5.  Functions that do not return a value
This program will show the role of functions, which are "tasks" that help divide the program into logical blocks.

The goal of this program is to introduce the concept, as we will discuss functions in more details, but not necessarily
a function that does not return a value.

**TEXT SOURCE:**  25. Creating Your Own Functions; 95. Writing Your Own Functions

## 6.  Functions that return a value
In the textbook, there was an example of a function that returns a value based on its job.  This program will show
another example of a function that returns a value.  This concept will be covered in detail later in the course.

**TEXT SOURCE:**  25. Creating Your Own Functions; 95. Writing Your Own Functions

## 7.  EXTRA LEARNING:  Input via keyboard
You can run a python script and interactivity get input.  This example will demonstrate how to get input from
the keyboard while a Python script is running.

## 8.  EXTRA LEARNING:  Use of a "main" function.
In other programming languages, there is defined starting point.  Languages like C, C++, C#, and Java have a "main"
function, which is where all programs will be begin.  Python does not have a "main" function.

However, in other texts and sample code you may find, a fake "main" function is used to simulate the starting point
of a Python script.  This example will show you a "main" function at work in Python.
