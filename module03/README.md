# Module 03
All sample files will be sorted in order to run.  For reference, a list of programs will be provided in this page.  Please see the README.md file in the root of this repository for directions on how to clone the files to your Codio environment.

6.  Nested FOR Loop Example

## 1.  FOR Loop Example
This example uses a for loop to display the value of the counter variable.

**TEXT SOURCE:**  64. Ranges
***Added 5/25:*** This is a variation of the previous example where variables are being used to represent the various
components of a range function that is used in FOR loops.

## 1a.  FOR Loop Example

## 2.  WHILE Loop Summation Example
This example will add a series of numbers in sequence (ie. 1+2+3)

**TEXT SOURCE:**  60. While Loops

## 3.  WHILE Loop Input Validation
This program will not proceed until a valid value has been entered.  This program is extension
of Example Program #2.

**TEXT SOURCE:**  60. While Loops

## 3.  WHILE Loop Sentinel Value
This program will continue to accept input until you enter a value that will force the program to exit.

**TEXT SOURCE:**  60. While Loops

## 5.  Nested FOR Loop Example
This example will produce a basic pattern on screen.

**TEXT SOURCE:**  62. Nested Loops

## 6.  EXTRA LEARNING:  Infinite Loop
An *infinite loop* is a logic error the error to end.  If you run this example, you will need to know
how to break out the of the loop.  In Codio environment, use CTRL+Break on your keyboard to accomplish this goal.
