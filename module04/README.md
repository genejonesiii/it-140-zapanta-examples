## 1.  List Basics
This program will initialize a list, access and manipulate individual elements and print out results to the screen.

**TEXT SOURCE:**  74. Creating Lists; 

## 2.  Lists and Loops
This program will iterate through a list and print out the results.

**TEXT SOURCE:**  60. While Loops

## 3.  Dictionary Examples
This program is an example of using a dictionary.  The program will print the results of the dictionary,
manipulate data, and print the results again.  We will use a loop to iterate and print out the dictionary.

**TEXT SOURCE:**  84.  Creating Dictionaries; 85.  Working with Dictionaries; 86. Modifying Dictionaries

## 3.  WHILE Loop Sentinel Value
This program will continue to accept input until you enter a value that will force the program to exit.

## 4.  Two-Dimensional Lists
This example shows how to work with 2-D lists
